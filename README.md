# kitepaint

A site for kite colorizers.

KitePaint.com is a side project made by Spencer Watson. The goal of the project is to have a powerful, usable platform for creating and sharing custom site designs. It will serve as a sort of social media platform with account creation, and sharing pf designs.

This GitHub repo is the code base for the site. I do retain the rights to the site and to my code. If others would like to use some of the methods found in my code base for non-competitive purposes, you are welcome to do so.

This GitHub repo serves as my project management system. All errors, features, and improvements are tracked using GitHub's ticketing system. If you are experiencing an issue with KitePaint, submit a ticket in the issues tab.
