<h1>About</h1>
<p>I created KitePaint.com as a pet project to experiment with full stack development, and full site creation using angularJS and ui-router. This site is an experiment and a learning experience. While I am experimenting with these technologies, I figured that I might as well make something useful, and maybe even a little profitable.</p><br/>
<p>I created a colorizer application for <a target="_blank" href="http://revkites.com">Revolution Kites</a> some time ago that serves as the initial inspiration for this site. I wanted to expand on what I had made for Revolution, but make it bigger, more fun, and more accessable for more people. I wanted all kite manufactuers to have the ability to get their own colorizers for a reasonable price. I wanted to make the custom kite ordering process easier for consumers. So, this site is the result. It is built around the concept of saveing and sharing custom kite designs.</p><br/>

<p>Thanks for checking out KitePaint.com!<br/>
