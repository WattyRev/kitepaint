# components

The Components folder holds coordinating or presentational React Components.

## Coordinating

Coordinating Component's responsibility is to connect presentational and container components together.

## Presentational

Presentational Component's responsibility is to the UI. These components usually don't have any logic unless that logic is specifically about display.

## Container Components

Containers live in the `../containers` folder. They are responsible for data management. I.e., retrieving the data, manipulating it, and providing it to its children.
