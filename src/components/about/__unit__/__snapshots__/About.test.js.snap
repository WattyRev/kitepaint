    I started creating KitePaint.com in 2014 as a pet project to experiment with full stack development. At the time, I built it using AngularJS, but I started rebuilding the front end in React in 2018. This site is an experiment and a learning experience. While I am experimenting with these technologies, I figured that I might as well make something useful, and maybe even a little profitable.

    I created a colorizer application for
     
    <a
      href="http://revkites.com"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      target="_blank"
    >
      Revolution Kites
    </a>
     
    some time ago that serves as the initial inspiration for this site. I wanted to expand on what I had made for Revolution, but make it bigger, more fun, and more accessable for more people. I wanted all kite manufactuers to have the ability to get their own colorizers for a reasonable price. I wanted to make the custom kite ordering process easier for consumers. So, this site is the result. It is built around the concept of saving and sharing custom kite designs.
